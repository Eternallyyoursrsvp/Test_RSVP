## üéâ General Wedding RSVP Questions

### Q: When should I RSVP to a wedding?
**A:** As soon as possible, ideally within 1-2 weeks of receiving the invitation. The couple needs time to plan catering, seating, and other arrangements. Never wait until the deadline unless absolutely necessary.

### Q: Can I change my RSVP after submitting?
**A:** Yes! Use the same link from your original invitation to update your response. However, changes close to the wedding date may not be possible due to catering and venue requirements.

### Q: What if I'm not sure I can attend?
**A:** Select "Maybe" if available, or contact the couple directly. They prefer honest uncertainty over last-minute cancellations. You can update your response when your plans are clearer.

### Q: Can I bring a plus-one if not specifically invited?
**A:** Only bring additional guests if your invitation specifically allows it. Guest lists are carefully planned based on venue capacity and budget. When in doubt, ask the couple directly.

## üë• Plus-Ones & Family Questions

### Q: My invitation says "and family" - who can I bring?
**A:** "And family" typically means your spouse/partner and children living at home. If you're unsure about extended family members, check with the couple.

**A:** List each child's dietary restrictions separately in the appropriate fields. Include allergies, preferences, and any special accommodations needed. Be specific to help the caterers plan properly.

### Q: Can I substitute my plus-one for someone else?
**A:** Usually yes, but inform the couple of the change. They may want to know who's attending for seating arrangements and name cards.

### Q: My plus-one can't come anymore - should I find someone else?
**A:** It's fine to attend alone, or you can invite someone else if the couple is comfortable with it. Check with them first, especially close to the wedding date.

## üçΩÔ∏è Food & Dietary Questions

### Q: I have severe food allergies - how do I communicate this?
**A:** Use the dietary restrictions field and be very specific. For life-threatening allergies, also contact the couple directly to discuss with the caterer. Don't rely solely on the RSVP form for serious medical needs.

### Q: What if I don't like any of the meal options?
**A:** Choose the closest option and mention your preferences in the comments. Most caterers can accommodate reasonable substitutions. Contact the couple if you have significant concerns.

### Q: Can I request a vegan/kosher/halal meal?

## üè® Travel & Accommodation Questions

### Q: The couple mentioned room blocks - how do I book?
**A:** Check your invitation or the wedding website for hotel information and booking codes. Book early as room blocks have limited availability and may expire before the wedding.

### Q: Should I book my accommodation through the couple's recommendations?
**A:** It's courteous to use their recommended hotels when possible, as they often get group rates. However, you're free to book elsewhere if needed.

## üíª Technical Questions

**A:** Try rotating to landscape mode, clearing your browser cache, or using a different browser. If problems persist, use a computer or contact the couple for help.

### Q: I never received a confirmation email - did my RSVP go through?
**A:** Check your spam folder first. If you received a confirmation message on the website, your RSVP likely went through. Contact the couple if you're concerned.

### Q: Can I RSVP over the phone instead of online?
**A:** While most couples prefer online RSVPs for accuracy, you can contact them directly if you're unable to use the online system.

### Q: I accidentally submitted twice - is this a problem?

**A:** This varies by wedding, but typically 1-2 weeks before the event is the absolute latest. Catering numbers are usually finalized about a week before the wedding.

## üéä Etiquette & Social Questions

**A:** Not at all! Couples understand that not everyone can attend. It's better to decline than to attend reluctantly or cancel last-minute.

**A:** A brief explanation is courteous but not required. You can include a personal note in the RSVP comments or send a separate message to the couple.

### Q: Can I request to sit with specific people?

## üíù Gift & Registry Questions

## üö® Emergency & Last-Minute Questions

## üîê Admin & Platform Management Questions

### Q: I'm setting up the platform for the first time - where are my admin credentials?
**A:** Check the server console logs when you first start the platform. You'll see a credentials box with a one-time password. Save these immediately as they won't be shown again!

### Q: What's the difference between Database Auth and Supabase Auth?
**A:** Database Auth (default) is enterprise-grade authentication built into the platform with no external dependencies. Supabase Auth offers advanced features like magic links and OAuth but requires a Supabase account.

### Q: Can I switch between authentication methods after setup?
**A:** Yes! Admins can switch between Database Auth and Supabase Auth through the admin settings. The switch happens without downtime and configuration is preserved.

### Q: What happens if Supabase goes down?
**A:** The platform automatically falls back to Database Auth. Users can continue to authenticate and access the platform without interruption.

### Q: I forgot my admin password - how do I reset it?
**A:** For Database Auth, you can reset through the platform's password recovery or contact platform support. For Supabase Auth, use Supabase's password reset functionality.

### Q: How do I know which authentication method is currently active?
**A:** Check the server console logs - you'll see messages like "üîê Using database authentication" or "üîê Using supabase authentication" on startup.

### Q: Can I test Supabase Auth before switching permanently?
**A:** Yes! Use the "Test Connection" feature in the authentication settings to verify your Supabase configuration before switching.

### Q: What security features are included in the authentication system?
**A:** Both systems include enterprise-grade security: password hashing (bcrypt 12 rounds), account locking, session management, audit logging, and enterprise password policies.
