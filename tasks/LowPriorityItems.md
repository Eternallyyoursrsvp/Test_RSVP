# Low Priority Items

## AI Communication Orchestration Engine

**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Effort**: 8-10 days  
**Dependencies**: Communication system refactoring (completed)  
**Owner**: Backend + AI/ML Team  

### Description
Implement an intelligent communication orchestration engine that uses AI and machine learning to optimize communication channel selection, timing, and content personalization for maximum guest engagement.

### Key Features
- **AI-driven Channel Selection**: ML models to predict optimal communication channel (email, SMS, WhatsApp) per guest based on response history and preferences
- **Intelligent Timing Optimization**: Time series analysis for optimal send times based on guest time zones, behavior patterns, and engagement history
- **Dynamic Content Personalization**: NLP-driven content adaptation based on guest preferences, cultural context, and relationship to couple
- **Predictive Deliverability Optimization**: ML models to predict and prevent deliverability issues before they occur
- **Multi-channel Campaign Orchestration**: Seamless coordination across all communication channels with unified analytics

### Technical Requirements
- Integration with existing unified communication system
- Real-time guest engagement scoring
- ML model training pipeline for continuous improvement
- Performance target: 25-40% improvement in engagement rates
- Predictive provider routing maintaining 99.5%+ deliverability

### Implementation Steps
1. **ML Infrastructure Setup**: Set up model training and inference infrastructure
2. **Data Pipeline**: Create data collection and feature engineering pipeline
3. **Channel Preference Models**: Develop and train channel preference prediction models
4. **Timing Optimization**: Implement time series analysis for optimal timing
5. **Content Personalization Engine**: Build NLP-driven content personalization
6. **Provider Optimization**: Implement predictive provider routing and failover
7. **Campaign Orchestration**: Build multi-channel campaign coordination
8. **Analytics Integration**: Connect with unified analytics system
9. **A/B Testing Framework**: Implement testing framework for continuous improvement
10. **Production Deployment**: Deploy with monitoring and performance tracking

### Success Metrics
- 25%+ improvement in channel selection accuracy vs manual selection
- 30%+ increase in click-through rates from personalized content
- 99.5%+ deliverability across all channels
- <200ms response time for AI recommendations
- Continuous learning with 5%+ monthly improvement in engagement rates

### Notes
This feature will significantly enhance the communication system's effectiveness but is not critical for core functionality. Can be implemented after the main system is stable and in production use.
